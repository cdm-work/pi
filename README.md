## &pi;

Calculates &pi; value using Fabrice Bellard's formula.

&Pi; value is computed with moderate speed. For example calculation
1'000'000 digits of &pi; on NanoPi M3 takes about 5 min. The program was
written mainly for testing system stability and as a benchmark. The
program source code (written in C) has only ~250 lines.

All available CPU cores are used for calculations.
